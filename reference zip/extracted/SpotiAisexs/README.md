## About

SpotiAisexs is a native Android client for Last.fm — built with Jetpack Compose and designed around Material 3 Expressive. It comes with its own scrobbler built in,  Sign in with your Last.fm account, grant notification access, and it just tracks what you're playing — from any app.

## The Scrobbler


- Detects what's playing through Android's own MediaSession framework — works with whatever app you're already using, no extra setup per-app beyond picking which apps to watch.
- You choose which apps it pays attention to, and it can auto-detect common music players for you.
- Scrobble threshold (% played before it counts) is adjustable.
- Handles repeats, resuming a paused track, and switching between apps correctly — these are easy to get wrong, so I spent real time on them.
- Strips the "- Topic" suffix YouTube Music adds to auto-generated channel names, so your artist names stay clean.
- Has a live debug log in Settings, so if something isn't scrobbling you can actually see why instead of guessing.

## Design

Built around Material 3 Expressive — grouped containers, real press animations, and haptics where they matter, not just sprinkled everywhere.

- Material You dynamic color from your wallpaper, plus a Dynamic Now Playing theme that pulls its accent from whatever's currently playing.
- Native Android Predictive Back support.
- Custom variable typography using Google Sans Flex.

---

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Hilt, Room, DataStore
- Retrofit + OkHttp
- Last.fm API

## Getting Started

1. Install SpotiAisexs.
2. Open it and tap **Connect with Last.fm** — this opens Chrome to sign in, so your password never touches the app itself.
3. Grant notification access when asked, so the scrobbler can see what's playing.
4. That's it — your stats and feed load automatically from there.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duxtami/SpotiAisexs-native.git
cd SpotiAisexs-native
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
