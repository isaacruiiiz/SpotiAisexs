/**
 * Port of the original's `lw_playlists` localStorage array (playlist.js's
 * _plSave/_plLoad): one row per saved playlist. [tracksJson] holds the
 * track list serialized as JSON (name/artist/url/image/listeners/playcount/
 * match/album per entry) rather than a normalized child table — this
 * mirrors the original's `{ id, title, subtitle, mode, tracks, date }` shape
 * exactly and keeps read/write a single round trip, same as the original's
 * single localStorage key.
 *
 * [discoverSignature] is only set for mode == "discover" (Save As Playlist's
 * order-preserving track-set signature, used to detect "this exact Discover
 * feed is already saved" — see _discTrackSignature in the original).
