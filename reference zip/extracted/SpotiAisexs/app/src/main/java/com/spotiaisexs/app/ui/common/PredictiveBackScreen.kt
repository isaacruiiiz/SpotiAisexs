/**
 * Wraps a pushed screen (Settings / Search / Discover / Genres — any
 * NavHost destination reached by navigating on top of MainShell) with
 * Android's Predictive Back visuals: as the user drags the system back
 * gesture in from the edge, this screen scales down and its corners round
 * off — the same "lifting off the stack" treatment modern Google apps use.
 * Releasing past the gesture's commit point finishes the animation and
 * calls [onBack] (pop the stack); releasing early cancels and the screen
 * springs back to full size.
 *
 * Anchored to the edge the gesture actually started from, not the screen's
 * center: BackEventCompat reports which edge (LEFT/RIGHT) and how far down
 * the screen (touchY) the drag began, and the shrink's pivot is set to
 * that exact point via TransformOrigin. That's what makes it read as
 * "shrinking away from the corner/edge you dragged from" instead of
 * uniformly shrinking toward the middle of the screen — the same
 * touch-anchored feel the system's own predictive back uses, and it also
 * nudges the screen a few dp further toward that edge as it shrinks, on
 * top of the scale, for the same reason.
 *
 * This animates the CURRENT (exiting) screen only — since NavHost here
 * only keeps the active back-stack entry composed, there's no destination
 * screen underneath to reveal/blur during the gesture. A blurred preview
 * of the previous screen would need it kept composed alongside this one
 * (e.g. via a two-pane Crossfade or navigation-compose 2.8+'s built-in
 * predictive-back transitions) — noted as a follow-up if that fuller
 * effect is wanted; this still gives real, system-driven progress-based
 * animation rather than a canned pop transition.
 *
 * Falls back gracefully pre-Android 13 / wherever predictive back isn't
 * available: PredictiveBackHandler's Flow simply completes without
 * meaningful per-frame progress, so [onBack] still fires correctly — just
 * without the scale/round animation playing first.
