/**
 * "Start Mix with this Song" (§6) needs to reach GenerateViewModel — which
 * lives on the Create tab, not wherever the track menu was opened from
 * (Home, Discover, Search, Playlist, Genres). Same cross-component signal
 * pattern as AuthDeepLinkDispatcher: a singleton SharedFlow, one emitter
 * (TrackContextMenuSheet's default Start Mix action), two collectors
 * (GenerateViewModel applies the seed and generates; MainShell switches
 * the pager to the Create tab). Neither collector needs to know about the
 * other, and this works whether MainShell is currently visible or sitting
 * underneath a pushed screen like Discover — its composition (and this
 * LaunchedEffect) isn't disposed just because it's not on top.
